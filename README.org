* coerce-cljc

  [[https://clojars.org/coerce-cljc][file:https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/coerce-cljc.svg]]

  A Clojure/ClojureScript library for coercing simple values to another
  type, ie, strings to dates, strings to integers, dates to strings,
  etc.

  The goal is to have single function (coerce ...) that will 'do the
  right most of the time' and allow for overriding for specific use
  cases.

  This library is opinionated, for example anywhere it can reduce a
  coercion to nil it will to so.  I find this the sanest approach, YMMV.
